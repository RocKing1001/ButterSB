# ButterSB
This is a Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.18.1 which adds QOL features for Hypixel Skyblock
This is meant as a replacement for all the popular 1.8.9 mods for the gamemode, but for a newer version so it can be used with sodium for increased performance
This can also be used to play on Hypixel SMP without changing versions

# NOTE VERY WIP - DOES NOT HAVE ANY GODO FEATURES AS OF NOW

## TODO
also wip (._.)
- REI Integration to provide an items menu for skyblock items, similar to Not Enough Updates
- Like... a 100 more features.. idk man this is effort and I only learnt how to code mods in the past week
